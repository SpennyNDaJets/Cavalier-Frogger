This game is designed in a fashion similar to frogger.
It is a two player game, one Hokie and one Cavalier, in which they race against each other
to collect coins and reach the goal on the other side of the road. They must avoid the 6 lanes
of cars. Each player starts out with 10 lives and 0 points.

The features used were:
    *2 player game where players directly interact - cav can push the hokie
    *Enemies - cars take lives awayfrom players when hit
    *Collectables - coins add 1 score point, target adds 5 score points
    *Timer - counts down from 60 seconds
    Health meter (lives) - each player starts game with 10 lives

Cav uses arrow keys to move. Hokie uses "w"-up, "a"-left, "s"-down, and "d"-right to move.
Reach the target without getting hit by cars to score. Player with the highest score when both
lives run out, or when timer hits 0, wins.
